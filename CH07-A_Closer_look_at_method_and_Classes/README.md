# A Closer Look at Methods and Classes

## Introducing Access Control

## public
	When a member of a class is modified by public, then that member can be accessed by any other code. When a member of a class is specified as private, then that member can only be accessed by other members of its class. Now you can understand why main( ) has always been preceded by the public modifier. It is called by code that is outside the programâ€”that is, by the Java run-time system. 
	When no access modifier is used, then by default the member of a class is public within its own package, but cannot be accessed outside of its package. (Packages are discussed in the following chapter.)

## Understanding static

Single copy of variable.

Methods declared as static have several restrictions:

* They can only directly call other static methods.
* They can only directly access static data.
* They cannot refer to this or super in any way. (The keyword super relates to inheritance and is described in the next chapter.)

If you need to do computation in order to initialize your static variables, you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded. The following example shows a class that has a static method, some static variables, and a static initialization block:


```
class UseStatic{
	static int a= 3;
	static int b;

	static void main(int x){
		---
	}

	static{
		b=a*4
	}


}
```
```
As soon as the UseStatic class is loaded, all of the static statements are run. First, a is set to 3, then the static block executes, which prints a message and then initializes b to a*4 or 12. Then main( ) is called, which calls meth( ), passing 42 to x. The three println( ) statements refer to the two static variables a and b, as well as to the local variable x.
```

Outside of the class in which they are defined, static methods and variables can be used independently of any object. To do so, you need only specify the name of their class followed by the dot operator. For example, if you wish to call a static method from outside its class, you can do so using the following general form:
classname.method( )



## Introducing final
In addition to fields, both method parameters and local variables can be declared final. Declaring a parameter final prevents it from being changed within the method. Declaring a local variable final prevents it from being assigned a value more than once.

## Introducing Nested and Inner Classes

* It is possible to define a class within another class; such classes are known as nested classes. The scope of a nested class is bounded by the scope of its enclosing class. Thus, if class B is defined within class A, then B does not exist independently of A. A nested class has access to the members, including private members, of the class in which it is nested. However, the enclosing class does not have access to the members of the nested class. A nested class that is declared directly within its enclosing class scope is a member of its enclosing class. It is also possible to declare a nested class that is local to a block.
* There are two types of nested classes: static and non-static.
* A static nested class is one that has the static modifier applied. Because it is static, it must access the non-static members of its enclosing class through an object. That is, it cannot refer to non-static members of its enclosing class directly. Because of this restriction, static nested classes are seldom used.
* The most important type of nested class is the inner class. An inner class is a non-static nested class. It has access to all of the variables and methods of its outer class and may refer to them directly in the same way that other non-static members of the outer class do.
